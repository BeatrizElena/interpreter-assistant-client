## Interpreter Assistant app

The Interpreter Assistant app is my capstone project for GA's Web Development Immersive class. It is a SPA that allows interpreters  to better prepare for their interpreting assignment by finding information about the providers for whom they interpret and by writing preparation and/or debriefing notes about their encounters. The user, once registered, can create session notes, can see all her notes in a list or one at a time, can update sessions notes, and can delete them. The design and development process began with user stories, wireframes, and ERDs. Then the back end was implemented and the CRUD actions tested with curl scripts and/or through Postman. Finally, the client side was linked to the API and deployed to a GitHub site.

### Challenges Faced / Problem Solving Strategies

UI design is an area that needs more development. So far, problem-solving involves a lot of online searches and trial and error of CSS and bootstrap. 

### Unsolved Problems / Future Plans

On the client side, major goals are to make the app look more appealing and be more user-friendly. Once a new MVP that incorporates these features is in place, I plan to test it at Dana Farber. There will be at least 2-3 of us who would test the app under real-life conditions.
